  {
    q: "Since you started using AI tools, what changed most in your daily routine?",
    a: `The biggest shift is that I now prototype in code. I'll build the actual flow and test it the same day. Sometimes I'll even set up Claude Code to build overnight and wake up to something I can already poke at.

So my day has shifted from pushing pixels to designing the logic and behavior beneath the experience. For instance, in the agentic work I'm doing, I spend much more time thinking about how an agent should reason: what it should recommend, what it should hold back, and how it should collaborate with users, beyond what it should appear in the chat screen.`,
  },
  {
    q: "When a PM or engineer shows up with something already built — how do you respond as a designer?",
    a: `I don't take it as a threat. I take it as a starting point.

When someone shows up with something already working, that's honestly a gift. We now have a real artifact to respond to, rather than arguing in the abstract. My first move is to understand the intent. What problem were they actually trying to solve?

Then I pressure-test it against the real user flow. I look at the edge cases, the moments where someone might get confused or stuck, and whether the experience stays consistent at the system level.

What I bring isn't, "I'm the only one who can make this look good." It's the judgment to determine whether it truly works for the person on the other end.`,
  },
  {
    q: "What skill sets would you tell junior designers to develop right now to stay relevant?",
    a: `Stop competing with AI on output speed. You'll lose, and that was never the point anyway.

Build the judgment layer instead: systems thinking, the ability to design behavior and logic rather than just screens, and taste — meaning knowing why one solution is better than another.

Get comfortable prototyping with AI tools and reading at least some code, because the wall between design and build is basically gone. And don't underrate communication or accessibility. If you can clearly articulate the "why" and design for the people who are usually left out, you'll stay relevant no matter where the tools go.`,
  },
  {
    q: "How has your relationship with PM and Engineering changed since AI entered the design process?",
    a: `The roles themselves have shifted. Designers write code now, PMs can prototype their own ideas directly, and engineers can shape a clearly thought-out PRD — the work isn't locked to a single title anymore. At first, that was uncomfortable, even a little disorienting for all of us.

But pretty quickly, we realized it actually frees each of us to lean harder into what we're best at.

PM isn't the person who documents things — they lead the team and hold the shared vision. Designer isn't just turning out mockups; as the person who understands the user best, I get to build experiences that are more refined and far more rigorously tested. And engineers move past pure implementation to explore and propose more innovative technical directions.

Once we let go of being defensive about our output, AI didn't blur the boundaries of our roles so much as it woke up our instinct for the part AI can't replace.`,
